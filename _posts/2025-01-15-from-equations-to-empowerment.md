Photo: A group of students during one of our evening study sessions in Harare.

The photo above captures one of my favorite moments — a quiet evening when numbers, ideas, and laughter met under dim light. What looks like an ordinary study session was, for me, the spark that changed how I thought about technology and learning.

In 2020, I began tutoring high school students in mathematics. Most of them were curious about artificial intelligence — a term they often heard but rarely understood. Their questions were simple: "How does AI really work?" or "Can AI understand Shona?" When we tried interacting with AI chatbots, the responses were mostly, "I don't understand Shona yet." That moment stayed with me.

It made me realize that access to technology isn't just about internet connection or devices — it's about representation. If an intelligent system cannot recognize your language or culture, then it silently tells you that your context doesn't count.

So, I started connecting what they already knew — algebra, graphs, and the "line of best fit" — to how machines learn patterns. Suddenly, they understood that the logic behind machine learning was built on the same mathematics they practiced daily. The classroom transformed: AI stopped being magic and became math they could own.

Years later, this experience evolved into a broader goal — to design AI systems that teach, adapt, and include. At the University of Zimbabwe, my final-year project used satellite imagery to monitor Lake Chivero's water quality. But even that technical work carried the same lesson I'd first learned while tutoring: powerful models fail without local context. Whether it's ecological data or human language, systems must be designed with awareness of where and whom they serve.

Now, as I prepare to pursue graduate research in artificial intelligence and data science, I return often to this photo. It reminds me why I began — not with code or equations, but with people learning together.

My dream is to build AI system that understand, can adapt explanations, recognize local languages, and make education accessible anywhere. Because the real promise of AI isn't just automation; it's amplification — helping every person, in every context, realize that intelligence is something we share, not something built apart from us.
