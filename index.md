<h1>Kudzaishe Mwaza</h1>
<h2>STEM Tutor&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspiring AI & Robotics Researcher</h2>

<p>
  I'm a tech enthusiast passionate about the intersection of <strong>education, robotics, and artificial intelligence</strong>.
  Currently, I teach <strong>STEM subjects</strong> to high school students, helping them build strong conceptual foundations and curiosity-driven thinking.
</p>

<p>
  My journey in <strong>Mechatronics Engineering</strong> sparked a deep interest in how intelligent systems can solve real-world problems — from autonomous robots to AI-driven learning tools.
  I enjoy bridging complex technical ideas with accessible explanations that empower others to learn and create.
</p>

<p>
  I'm now preparing to <strong>pursue graduate studies</strong> in <strong>Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong>, focusing on AI and robotics research.
  My long-term goal is to build technologies that advance <strong>education, accessibility, and sustainable development</strong> across Africa and beyond.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not teaching or studying, I love exploring new ideas in <strong>machine learning</strong>, reading about <strong>human-centered AI</strong>, and sharing what I learn with others.
